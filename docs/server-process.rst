.. _server-process:

=============================
Starting & Proxying processes
=============================

Jupyter Server Proxy can start & supervise the process providing
the web service it is proxying. The process is started the first
time an appropriate URL is requested, and restarted if it fails.

Processes that are supervised and proxied are called **servers**.
They can be configured either in the notebook configuration, or
as separate packages.

Server Process options
======================

Server Processes are configured with a dictionary of key value
pairs.

``command``
^^^^^^^^^^^

   One of:

   * A list of strings that is the command used to start the
     process. The following template strings will be replaced:

     * ``{port}`` the port the process should listen on.

     * ``{base_url}`` the base URL of the notebook

     For example, if the application needs to know its full path it can
     be constructed from ``{base_url}/proxy/{port}``

   * A callable that takes any :ref:`callable arguments <server-process/callable-argument>`,
     and returns a list of strings that are used & treated same as above.

   This key is required.

``timeout``
^^^^^^^^^^^

   Timeout in seconds for the process to become ready, default ``5``.

   A process is considered 'ready' when it can return a valid HTTP response on the
   port it is supposed to start at.

``environment``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   One of:

   * A dictionary of strings that are passed in as the environment to
     the started process, in addition to the environment of the notebook
     process itself. The strings ``{port}`` and ``{base_url}`` will be
     replaced as for **command**.

   * A callable that takes any :ref:`callable arguments <server-process/callable-argument>`,
     and returns a dictionary of strings that are used & treated same as above.

``absolute_url``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   *True* if the URL as seen by the proxied application should be the full URL
   sent by the user. *False* if the URL as seen by the proxied application should
   see the URL after the parts specific to jupyter-server-proxy have been stripped.

   For example, with the following config:

   .. code:: python

      c.ServerProxy.servers = {
        'test-server': {
          'command': ['python3', '-m', 'http.server', '{port}'],
          'absolute_url': False
        }
      }

   When a user requests ``/test-server/some-url``, the proxied server will see it
   as a request for ``/some-url`` - the ``/test-server`` part is stripped out.

   If ``absolute_url`` is set to ``True`` instead, the proxied server will see it
   as a request for ``/test-server/some-url`` instead - without any stripping.

   This is very useful with applications that require a ``base_url`` to be set.

   Defaults to *False*.


``port``
^^^^^^^^

     Set the port that the service will listen on. The default is to
     automatically select an unused port.


``mappath``
^^^^^^^^^^^

     Map request paths to proxied paths.
     Either a dictionary of request paths to proxied paths,
     or a callable that takes parameter ``path`` and returns the proxied path.


``launcher_entry``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   A dictionary with options on if / how an entry in the classic Jupyter Notebook
   'New' dropdown or the JupyterLab launcher should be added. It can contain
   the following keys:

   #. **enabled**
      Set to True (default) to make an entry in the launchers. Set to False to have no
      explicit entry.

   #. **icon_path**
      Full path to an svg icon that could be used with a launcher. Currently only used by the
      JupyterLab launcher

   #. **title**
      Title to be used for the launcher entry. Defaults to the name of the server if missing.


``new_browser_tab``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   *JupyterLab only* - *True* if the proxied server URL should be opened in a new browser tab.
   *False* (default) if the proxied server URL should be opened in a new JupyterLab tab.

   If *False*, the proxied server needs to allow its pages to be rendered in an iframe. This
   is generally done by configuring the web server ``X-Frame-Options`` to ``SAMEORIGIN``.
   For more information, refer to
   `MDN Web docs on X-Frame-Options <https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options>`_.

   Note that applications might use a different terminology to refer to frame options.
   For example, RStudio uses the term *frame origin* and require the flag
   ``--www-frame-origin=same`` to allow rendering of its pages in an iframe.


#. **allow_restart_on_graceful_exit**
   *True* if the proxied server should be restartable even after exiting gracefully. *False* (default) if
   an error should be thrown if attempting to start a process that previously exited gracefully.


.. _server-processes/callable-arguments:

Callable arguments
------------------

Any time you specify a callable in the config, it can ask for any arguments it needs
by simply declaring it - only arguments the callable asks for will be passed to it.

For example, with the following config:

.. code:: python

   def _cmd_callback():
       return ['some-command']

   server_config = {
       'command': _cmd_callback
   }

No arguments will be passed to ``_cmd_callback``, since it doesn't ask for any. However,
with:

.. code:: python

   def _cmd_callback(port):
       return ['some-command', '--port=' + str(port)]

   server_config = {
       'command': _cmd_callback
   }

The ``port`` argument will be passed to the callable. This is a simple form of dependency
injection that helps us add more parameters in the future without breaking backwards
compatibility.

Available arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, the following arguments are available:

#. **port**
   The port the command should listen on

#. **base_url**
   The base URL of the notebook

If any of the returned strings, lists or dictionaries contain strings
of form ``{<argument-name>}``, they will be replaced with the value
of the argument. For example, if your function is:

.. code:: python

   def _openrefine_cmd():
       return ['openrefine', '-p', '{port}']

The ``{port}`` will be replaced with the appropriate port before
the command is started

Specifying config via traitlets
===============================

`Traitlets <https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/>`_ are the configuration
mechanism used by Jupyter Notebook. It can take config in Python
and we can use that to specify Server Processes - including functions
if we want tighter control over what process is spawned.

#. Create a file called ``jupyter_notebook_config.py`` in one of the
   Jupyter config directories. You can get a list of these directories
   by running ``jupyter --paths`` and looking under the 'config'
   section

#. Add your Server Process configuration there by setting
   ``c.ServerProxy.servers`` traitlet.

   For example,

   .. code:: python

      c.ServerProxy.servers = {
        'openrefine': {
          'command': ['refine', '-p', '{port}']
        }
      }

   This will start `OpenRefine <http://openrefine.org/>`_ with the
   ``refine`` command (which must be in $PATH) on a randomly
   generated port, and make it available under ``/openrefine``
   in your notebook url. The URL path is specified by the key,
   but this should be made more configurable in the future.

.. _server-process/package:

Specifying config from python packages
======================================

It is often convenient to provide the Server Process configuration
as a python package, so users can simply ``pip install`` it.
This is possible, thanks to `the magic of entrypoints
<https://amir.rachum.com/blog/2017/07/28/python-entry-points/>`_.

We'll work through it by repeating the OpenRefine example from
above.

#. Create a python file named ``openrefine.py``

   .. code:: python

    def setup_openrefine():
      return {
        'command': ['refine', '-p', '{port}']
      }

   A simple function that returns a Server Process configuration
   dictionary when called. This can return any kind of Server
   Process configuration dictionary, and include functions easily.

#. Make an appropriate ``setup.py``

   .. code:: python

      import setuptools

      setuptools.setup(
        name="jupyter-openrefine-server",
        # py_modules rather than packages, since we only have 1 file
        py_modules=['openrefine'],
        entry_points={
            'jupyter_serverproxy_servers': [
                # name = packagename:function_name
                'openrefine = openrefine:setup_openrefine',
            ]
        },
        install_requires=['jupyter-server-proxy'],
      )

   We make an entry for the ``jupyter_serverproxy_servers`` entrypoint.
   When jupyter-server-proxy starts up, it goes through the list of
   entrypoint entries from all installed packages & sets itself up
   with all the Server Process configurations.

#. You can now test this out with ``pip install .``, making sure you
   are in the same environment as the jupyter notebook process. If you
   go to ``<notebook-url>/openrefine`` (and have OpenRefine installed
   and in ``$PATH``!), you should see an instance of OpenRefine!
