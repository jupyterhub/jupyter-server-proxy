Jupyter Server Proxy lets you run arbitrary external processes (such
as RStudio, Shiny Server, syncthing, PostgreSQL, etc) alongside your
notebook, and provide authenticated web access to them.

**Note:** This project used to be called **nbserverproxy**. As
nbserverproxy is an older version of jupyter-server-proxy, uninstall
nbserverproxy before installing jupyter-server-proxy to avoid
conflicts.

The primary use cases are:

#. Use with JupyterHub / Binder to allow launching users into web
   interfaces that have nothing to do with Jupyter - such as RStudio,
   Shiny, or OpenRefine.
#. Allow access from frontend javascript (in classic notebook or
   JupyterLab extensions) to access web APIs of other processes
   running locally in a safe manner. This is used by the `JupyterLab
   extension <https://github.com/dask/dask-labextension>`_ for 
   `dask <https://dask.org/>`_.


`The documentation <https://jupyter-server-proxy.readthedocs.io/>`_
contains information on installation & usage.
